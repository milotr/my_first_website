DJANGO COMMAND LINES:
    django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME

    python3 manage.py startapp APP_NAME

    python3 manage.py runserver




### manage.py -- 

### views.py -- each views that someone can someone
usually by making function in python

### urls.py -- list of url names "urlpatterns" = [
    path("", views.function, name="index")
]
    name uses to reference to a website.

    urls.py for the entire project uses for linking all the application. 

    path('APP_NAME/', include("APP_NAME.urls"))

### settings.py -- created django uses for config

    INSTALLED_APPS. added by 'APP_NAME',


VARIABLES

views.py -- 
    def greet(request,name):
        return HttpResponse(f"Hello, {name}!")

urls.py
    path("<str:name>", views.greet, name="greet")

# this "<str:name>" will pass the parameter to the greet function.

views.py -- capitalize names 
    def greet(request,name):
        return HttpResponse(f"Hello, {name.capitalize()}!")

BEST PRACTICE:
Trying to seperate HTMLs in views.py by using the commands:
    def index(request):
        return render(request, "APP_NAME/name.html")

Making different folder calls "Templates". 

Since that we seperate HTMLs with views.py, we need a different command:
    def greet(request, name):
        return render(request, "hello/greet.html", {
            "name": name_capitalize() #giving access to a variable calls name and its value
        })
    # "name" is a string that is a variable that HTML has access to.
    # :"..." value of the variable that python refers to. 
    
    In order to name a variable in HTML: use {{ VARIALBE }} this will insert the value of the variable. 


CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
    Implement this in views.py function.
    {%%} - django logics in HTML

    {% if BOOLEAN%}
    {% else %}
    {% endif %}

    {% for n in list%}
    {{ n }}
    {% endfor %}

CSS
    CSS is applied for STATIC htmls which means that they don't change or not dynamic.
    html: href="{% static 'newyear/style.css' %}" #static means django will figure it out.

TEMPLATE INHERITANCE: 
    Making the same template by putting this:
        {% block body %}
        {% endblock %}
    replace the key part with and keep the identical parts the same. 

    For the key main part file, include this: 
        {% extends "APP_NAME/template.html" %}

        {% block body%}
        {% endblock %}

LINKING USING NAMES:
        <a href="{% url 'add' %}"> Add a new task </a> 
    The name 'add' is in urls.py of application tasks
    Python will figure out the html file.

Name collisions:
    In order to avoid this 
    Include:
        app_name = "..." into urls.py of the paplication
    into the specified html file.

    <a href="{% url 'app_name:add' %}"> Add a new task </a> 

FORM ATCTION METHOD:
<form action="{% url 'tasks:add' %}" method="post">
There are 2 methods: GET and POST
using post means for forms and sensitive information

Middle-ware: example POST requires CSRF 
It interveins the request and get progress.

So we need CSRF token by adding {{ csrf_token }}

Making forms by class from django makes things easier.

CLIENT-SERVER VALIDATION:
notes in tasks/views.py

SESSIONS:
Store data in different sessions
